# Langdock PDF Retrieval Example

Minimal example for retrieving PDF files generated by a Langdock assistant.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update `API_KEY` and `ASSISTANT_ID` in `retrieve_pdf_from_assistant.py`.

## Usage

```bash
python retrieve_pdf_from_assistant.py
```

## How It Works

1. **Create conversation**: Creates a conversation (required for attachments)
2. **Call assistant**: Sends message to assistant with conversation ID
3. **Extract attachments**: Finds attachment IDs in the response
4. **Download PDFs**: Downloads and saves each attachment as a PDF file

## Important Notes

- Attachments must be associated with a conversation. The script creates a conversation first, or uses one from the API response.
- The assistant must be configured to output attachments in `message.attachments`, not base64 in text.
- The download endpoint `/attachment/v1/{attachmentId}/download` may need to be confirmed with Langdock support.
