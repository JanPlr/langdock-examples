# Langdock Examples & Inspiration

Hi, I'm **Jan** 👋

I work at [Langdock](https://langdock.com) and created this repository to share ideas, examples, and inspiration for how to use Langdock and its surrounding products. This is a growing collection that I'll continue to expand over time with examples ranging from simple everyday use cases to advanced integrations and automations.

**Contributions welcome!** If you've built something cool with Langdock, I'd love to include it here.
