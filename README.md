# Langdock Examples & Inspiration

Hi, I'm **Jan** 👋

I work at [Langdock](https://langdock.com) and created this repository to share ideas, examples, and inspiration for how to use Langdock and its surrounding products. This is a growing collection that I'll continue to expand over time — and I'd love for you to contribute your own ideas too!

Langdock is an AI platform that helps teams work smarter. It provides:
- **AI Assistants** — Custom AI agents that can be configured for specific tasks
- **Chat Interface** — Conversational AI with access to multiple models
