# Langdock Examples & Inspiration

Hi, I'm **Jan** 👋

I work at [Langdock](https://langdock.com) and created this repository to share ideas, examples, and inspiration for how to use Langdock and its surrounding products. This is a growing collection that I'll continue to expand over time with examples ranging from simple everyday use cases to advanced integrations and automations.

**Contributions welcome!** If you've built something cool with Langdock, I'd love to include it here.

## What's in This Repo?

This repository contains examples for both **simple** everyday use cases and **advanced** integrations. Here's what's currently available:

### 📁 Simple Examples

#### [Tiny Apps Built by Langdock](./tiny-apps-build-by-langdock/)
Single-file HTML applications created entirely by Langdock AI. Just describe what you need, and download a working app. Includes PDF tools (compress, merge, split, convert) that run 100% locally in your browser.

**Skills demonstrated:** Using Langdock to generate complete, functional applications from natural language descriptions.

### 📁 Advanced Examples

#### [Langdock API Examples](./langdock-api-examples/)
Python code examples for interacting with the Langdock API programmatically:
- **Streaming Assistant** — Real-time streaming responses from AI assistants
- **PDF Retrieval** — Extract and work with PDF content via the API

**Skills demonstrated:** API integration, streaming responses, working with assistants programmatically.

#### [Sample API Key MCP Server](./sample-api-key-mcp-server/)
A template for building your own MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects Langdock to external APIs and services with API key authentication.

**Skills demonstrated:** MCP server development, extending Langdock with custom tools.

#### [Webinar Resources](./08-12-2025_Resources_From_Assistant_Webinar/)
Materials from the Assistant Webinar including:
- Example assistant configurations
- API cloning guides for assistants
